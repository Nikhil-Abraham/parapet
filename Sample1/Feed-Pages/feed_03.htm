              <p>Inequality is at the heart of many of the gravest issues facing the global community, including
                development, climate, and peace. It affects people and structures across societies and borders and
                threatens to stymie hard-fought development gains.
              </p>
              <p>A recent United Nations report shows that 20% of development progress was lost in recent years due to
                the unequal distribution of education, health, and living standards. The World Economic Forum has
                calculated that it will take women almost 100 years to reach gender equality. Exclusionary practices in
                security, justice, and politics are at the heart of many violent conflicts today. And it is seen as a
                key factor in the rise of protests around the globe, which shows no signs of abating in 2020.

                Toppling barriers to opportunity is key to making the transformative progress needed in 2020. As
                stressed in the 2019 Human Development Report, we need to evolve our understanding of inequality. Just
                as the SDGs replaced the more basic Millennium Development Goals, so, too, must we expand our definition
                of inequality to address the obstacles to 21st century skills and opportunities.

              <p>This perspective on inequality means understanding who is getting left behind – where, and how. The
                Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s annual Goalkeepers report measuring SDG progress noted that birthplace
                and gender are some of the most powerful predictors of future success. For many of the world’s poorest,
                including women and children, the odds are stacked against them simply because of where they were born.

                Another tool to address inequality is expanding measures of economic performance to account for social
                conditions, as many leading thinkers are starting to do. Some actors, though not nearly enough, are also
                taking action. New Zealand has created the world’s first ‘Well Being’ budget which balances economic
                measures with social indicators. And the Business Roundtable shook the business community with a
                statement that shifts company focus from shareholders to stakeholders.

                In 2020, the battle against inequality will take many forms. The 25th anniversary of the Fourth World
                Conference on Women in Beijing takes place amidst a groundswell of demands for women’s equality, rights,
                and justice. The Secretary-General is shining a light on the connection between human rights and
                inequality. And addressing inequality will be at the heart of the Decade of Action campaign on the SDGs,
                as it underpins progress across the framework.
