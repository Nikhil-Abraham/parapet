              <h2>CLIMATE CHANGE IS AFFECTING HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH IN A VARIETY OF WAYS</h2>
              <h5>The numbers are in: The past decade has been the warmest in recorded history. Deadly wildfires
                including those affecting Australia, hurricanes, extreme weather events, and climate-influenced
                migration and hunger in many parts of the world are now regular occurrences. Ice caps are melting, sea
                levels are rising, and the very survival of island nations is being threatened. Indeed, our entire
                ecosystem is at risk: 1 million animal and plant species may be extinct within years, the largest-scale
                ecological loss humans have seen. And a mounting global movement of youth impatient for change is
                pushing climate protection into the global consciousness like never before.

                We have a decade to significantly curb carbon emissions and avoid catastrophe. Because of years of
                delayed action, we face an even more pressing mandate. We need to halve global emissions by 2030 but the
                emissions gap between what is needed and our current commitments is significant. Starting this year, we
                need to cut emissions by 7.6% every year for the next 10 years to limit warming to 1.5 degrees.</h5>
              <img class="fakeimg" src="../Assets/fa01.jpg">
              <p>The UN’s Climate Action Summit last year set a roadmap for action and the UN Secretary-General
                continues to serve as a moral compass, pushing countries and other actors to do more, now: “If we do not
                change course by 2020 we risk missing the point where we can avoid runaway climate change with
                disastrous consequences for people and all the natural systems that sustain us.” And the 2019 United
                Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid (COP26) did not send a strong signal of positive intent.

                In 2020 we must decarbonize large swaths of the economy, shift financial flows, protect ecosystems, and
                adapt for the future. Countries are all expected to reduce more emissions under the Paris Agreement. The
                2020 Conference of the Parties in Glasgow, UK, will enable the global community to take stock of which
                nations stepped up and by how much. Yet the countries who have so far pledged to cut carbon outputs at
                the highest rates represent under 10% of those producing global emissions. At current rates, that means
                that temperatures will rise more than 3 degrees this century.

                We need all countries, and especially leading economies, to sign off this year on bolder commitments and
                actions.

                This also means generating robust international agreement on biodiversity at the UN Biodiversity
                Conference in October 2020. Such an agreement must protect and preserve our natural environment, support
                individual actions, and encourage strong and diverse leadership from the private sector, regional
                governments and bodies, and civil society organizations. It also means focusing on the social dimensions
                of climate change, including gender and health.

                There is good news to be had, which we can hope will deepen in 2020: Individuals, including the younger
                generation and tomorrow’s leaders, are taking to the streets to push for climate action like never
                before. Public opinion is shifting. And leadership is growing in cities and boardrooms alike.</p>
