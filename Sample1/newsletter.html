              <h1 class="nwsltr-title">CLIMATE CHANGE IS AFFECTING HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH IN A VARIETY OF WAYS</h1>
              <p>The numbers are in: The past decade has been the warmest in recorded history. Deadly wildfires
                including those affecting Australia, hurricanes, extreme weather events, and climate-influenced
                migration and hunger in many parts of the world are now regular occurrences. Ice caps are melting, sea
                levels are rising, and the very survival of island nations is being threatened. Indeed, our entire
                ecosystem is at risk: 1 million animal and plant species may be extinct within years, the largest-scale
                ecological loss humans have seen. And a mounting global movement of youth impatient for change is
                pushing climate protection into the global consciousness like never before.</p>

              <h1 class="nwsltr-title">The relationship between climate, the SDGs(Sustainable Dvelopment Goals), and
                peace has come into
                greater
                focus.</h1>
              <p>To be sure, the world has made substantial strides: The extreme poverty rate has fallen below 8%, the
                lowest recorded level in human history. For the first time since the start of the SDGs, the number of
                people
                in extreme poverty in Africa is decreasing. India, once a global hot spot for poverty, is now on track
                to
                end extreme poverty. Children around the world are living longer and healthier lives. The mortality rate
                in
                children under five has nearly halved over the last twenty years and more children than ever are
                receiving
                an education, getting necessary vaccinations, and drinking clean water. More people have access to
                electricity and nearly three-quarters of the world has essential health services.</p>

              <h1 class="nwsltr-title">INEQUALITY AND EXCLUSION IN FOCUS</h1>
              <p>A recent United Nations report shows that 20% of development progress was lost in recent years due to
                the unequal distribution of education, health, and living standards. The World Economic Forum has
                calculated that it will take women almost 100 years to reach gender equality. Exclusionary practices in
                security, justice, and politics are at the heart of many violent conflicts today. And it is seen as a
                key factor in the rise of protests around the globe, which shows no signs of abating in 2020.

                Toppling barriers to opportunity is key to making the transformative progress needed in 2020. As
                stressed in the 2019 Human Development Report, we need to evolve our understanding of inequality. Just
                as the SDGs replaced the more basic Millennium Development Goals, so, too, must we expand our definition
                of inequality to address the obstacles to 21st century skills and opportunities.</p>

              <h1 class="nwsltr-title">CRISES ON THE BRINK: CONFLICT, PEACE, AND HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE</h1>
              <p>The year 2020 marks the ninth anniversary of the war in Syria, and the fifth in Yemen. Venezuela may
                very well become the source of the world’s largest and most underfunded refugee crisis. Lethal violence
                and violent crime is on the rise, affecting growing cities in an urbanizing world.
                These factors build on worrying trends from 2019, where more people required assistance than initially
                forecast due to conflicts and extreme weather-related disasters. Women and children are being
                disproportionately affected and are at higher risks of sexual and gender-based violence. Over 60% of the
                world’s chronically food insecure people live in countries affected by conflict.
