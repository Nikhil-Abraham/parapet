              <h3>The relationship between climate, the SDGs(Sustainable Dvelopment Goals), and peace has come into
                greater
                focus.

              </h3>
              <h5>To be sure, the world has made substantial strides: The extreme poverty rate has fallen below 8%, the
                lowest recorded level in human history. For the first time since the start of the SDGs, the number of
                people
                in extreme poverty in Africa is decreasing. India, once a global hot spot for poverty, is now on track
                to
                end extreme poverty. Children around the world are living longer and healthier lives. The mortality rate
                in
                children under five has nearly halved over the last twenty years and more children than ever are
                receiving
                an education, getting necessary vaccinations, and drinking clean water. More people have access to
                electricity and nearly three-quarters of the world has essential health services.</h5>

              <p>We will also see challenges in specific pockets in middle income countries and growing economies. And
                that
                is just the data we know. Poverty data for most of Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, comes from
                information
                gathered before the creation of the SDGs five years ago: a reminder that we urgently need more and
                better
                data if we are even to know for sure how we are doing, and what policies are working.Recognizing the
                potentially widening gap between ambition and reality in the years ahead, the Secretary-General has
                issued a
                global call for a decade of action to deliver the SDGs by 2030. This includes an annual gathering
                alongside
                the UN General Assembly to evaluate progress and retarget political will. And supporting the Decade of
                Action campaign will help spark meaningful commitments around climate, gender, and inequality.

                And at the High-Level Political Forum in July there is an opportunity to build on the scientist-authored
                Global Sustainable Development Report to drive systems change, strengthen national and private sector
                accountability, and elevate success stories. The Forum will reinforce the notion that the Goals apply to
                all
                countries, regardless of income level. The year 2020 must be one of strategic focus, prioritization, and
                specificity for the SDGs, with better metrics to hold governments accountable.</p>
